## ðŸ’« Stack & Greedy Challenge: Valid Parenthesis String (LeetCode 678)

**Problem:**  
Given a string containing '(', ')', and '*', check if itâ€™s valid. '*' can represent '(', ')', or an empty string.

**Approach:**  
Track a range [low, high] of possible open parentheses counts as you scan. Adjust bounds for each character, and ensure validity by the end.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

**Why this works:**  
Maintaining low and high counts simulates all interpretations of '*' without backtracking.

## ðŸ’« Math Challenge: Pascalâ€™s Triangle II (LeetCode 119)

**Problem:**  
Return the kth (0-indexed) row of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.

**Approach:**  
Build the row iteratively using previous values or use combinatorial math.

**Time Complexity:** O(kÂ²) or O(k) with combinatorics  
**Space Complexity:** O(k)  

**Why this works:**  
Each element depends on the sum of two elements above it, producing beautiful number patterns.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

- Creative range tracking solves ambiguous bracket problems efficiently.  
- Pascalâ€™s Triangle reveals deep connections between combinatorics and recursion.
