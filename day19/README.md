## ðŸ’« Stack Challenge: Valid Parentheses (LeetCode 20)

**Problem:**  
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets and in the correct order.

**Approach:**  
Use a stack to track opening brackets. For every closing bracket, check if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it doesnâ€™t or stack is empty, return false. In the end, stack should be empty.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)  

**Why this works:**  
Stack ensures order and matching types are validated in one pass, maintaining correct bracket pairing.

## ðŸ’« Greedy Challenge: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode 121)

**Problem:**  
Given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the ith day, find the maximum profit by buying and selling once.

**Approach:**  
Track the minimum price seen so far and calculate the profit if sold today. Update max profit accordingly.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

**Why this works:**  
By always buying at the lowest price and selling at a higher one, we maximize profit in a single pass.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

- Stack is perfect for matching problems requiring order validation.  
- Greedy strategies shine in single-pass profit calculations.
