# ðŸš€ Day 18 â€“ #DrGViswanathan 50 Days Coding Challenge  
Today weâ€™re simulating queues using only stacks and tackling the classic duplicate detection in arrays. Two simple yet powerful problems to level up those data structure skills.

## ðŸ’« Stack Simulation Challenge: Implement Queue using Stacks (LeetCode 232)  

### **Problem:**  
Implement a queue using only stack operations. The queue should support push(x), pop(), peek(), and empty().

### **Approach:**

- Use two stacks:  
  - `in_stack`: holds all newly pushed elements.  
  - `out_stack`: used when accessing elements in queue order.  
- On `push(x)`, add x to `in_stack`.  
- On `pop()` or `peek()`:  
  - If `out_stack` is empty, transfer all elements from `in_stack` to `out_stack` (reversing order).  
  - Then pop/peek from `out_stack`.  
- `empty()` returns True only if both stacks are empty.

### **Time Complexity:**   Amortized O(1) for all operations  
### **Space Complexity:**   O(n)

### **Why this works:**  
By deferring the reversal of elements until itâ€™s absolutely needed, we efficiently simulate a queue using the raw power of stacks.

## ðŸ’« Hash Set Challenge: Contains Duplicate (LeetCode 217)  

### **Problem:**  
Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice. Return false if every element is distinct.

### **Approach:**

- Use a set `seen` to track numbers encountered so far.  
- Loop through the array:  
  - If the number is already in `seen`, return True.  
  - Otherwise, add it to `seen`.  
- If the loop ends, return False.

### **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
### **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### **Why this works:**  
Sets provide O(1) lookups, so this approach avoids nested loops and gives us a clean, efficient solution.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:  

- Queue Logic with Stacks: Itâ€™s all about reversing flow only when necessary. Efficient use of two stacks gets the job done.

-  Duplicate Detection:  Tracking what's been seen saves time and avoids unnecessary scans.
